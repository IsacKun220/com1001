# COM1001 Spring 2022

## 1. Introduction

Welcome! This repository code examples, practical sheets, and slides to support
the Spring Semester of the COM1001 module "Introduction to Software Engineering"
at the University of Sheffield.

The lecture content of the Spring Semester focuses on Web Application
Development and Testing using [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) and a framework
called [Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com/). We will be learning
[RSpec](https://rspec.info/) to write tests. We will also be using other
technologies along the way, including
[Capybara](https://teamcapybara.github.io/capybara/) to automatically drive our
web applications for testing; [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) as a backend
database, and [Sequel](https://sequel.jeremyevans.net/) – an Object-Relational
Mapping framework.

Files will be added to this repository every week, so ensure that you regularly
do a `git pull`!
