# Week 2: Starting to Develop Your Team Web Application

Read this whole page first, then start to tackle each of the tasks. Don't leave
before doing no. 7 – deciding when and where you're going to meet next.

### 1. In your teams, start to think about the architectural design of your web application.

Take some of your key stories and discuss:

* What pages will be needed? 

* What will they look like and do? What forms are needed? (Note that we have not
  yet covered databases, but assume the user will be able to submit data via
  forms that you will be able to store data in a database for use elsewhere in
  the application.)

* How will these pages link together? For example, what will be the overall
  structure of the application, what hyperlinks are required, which pages are
  accessible only via form submissions.

### 2. In terms of the stories you discussed, and the pages you decided upon, and the eventual Sinatra application:

* What routes will be required?

* How might these routes be grouped into one or more distinct controller files?
  (For example, each different part of the system might have its own controller
  file, to keep all functionality for that part of the system together.)

* What views will you need? 

* What aspects of these views are "reusable" (e.g., common headers and footers
  in the application) that could form their own `.erb` files included into other
  views (see the "[Views of Views example](..//code//views/views_of_views/)" code
  example, discussed in lectures).

### 3. Ensure everyone in the team is capable of setting up and running a blank Sinatra application (i.e., initially, one that contains little to no code). 

This should have all  the directories as per the structure mentioned in
lectures. Make sure that: 

* You can successfully set up two or more routes, and can get them working

* You can get each route to utilise a "view"

* You can get one or more views to display images, and use a CSS file placed in
  (or, ideally, in subdirectories of) the `public` directory of the application

### 4. Responsibilities 

Start to decide how you're going to divide responsibility up for different parts
or aspects of the project. For example, who will be in charge of which stories?
**Make sure that each person has tasks that involve all aspects of development**
– i.e., that you don't have one or two people just programming, another just
testing, another just doing the views and so on. You may, however, want to
assign someone as "quality control" for each of those aspects, making sure they
get done. 

### 5. Initial Commit, Push 

Copy somebody's blank application into your project directory (you can do this
by right clicking in the filetree on Codio), commit and push it. Well done,
you've officially started your project! 

### 6. Forms and Querystrings

On your own, try to write a simple Sinatra application that handles a form, like
the examples covered in lectures. Complete the following tasks:

1. Set up a view with a form that has three fields. Make two versions, one that
   uses the `get` method to submit the form and one `post` that uses the post.

2. Get the receiving route (the one that the `action` attribute in the `form`
   tag sends the form data to) to print the values of each of the form fields
   entered to the web page. Don't forget to "escape" those values! (See the
   lecture slides as to how to do this)

3. Add some sanitisation and validation to the form. Ensure leading and trailing
   spaces are stripped from the user entered form field values. Ensure the first
   field is a valid string of no more than 10 characters. Ensure the second
   field is an integer. (Think about how to program the code needed to do these
   checks.) Ensure your view properly reports errors to the user if one or both
   of the fields is not entered correctly. 

4. Add some tests so that you can automatically check whether your
   forms are functioning correctly. 

5. Finally, try to achieve the same effect as the `get` form submission by
   programming a view with a link where the URL has a querystring that encodes
   two values corresponding to each field of the form. Again, if you're unsure, consult the lecture slides. If you're still unsure, ask your demonstrator!

### 7. Meeting Schedule

Finally, before you leave, decide how and where you're going to meet-up each
week, in person or online, to continue development on the project.
